# quanteda.textstats 0.94

* Move the S4 definitions for simil, dist, and proxy textstat classes from **quanteda** to **quanteda.textstats**.

# quanteda.textstats 0.93

* Minor changes to ensure compatibility with **quanteda** v3.

# quanteda.textstats 0.92

* Removed **data.table** dependency (#5).
* Removed older non-C++ keyness methods (#4).
* Removed code that was breaking the Solaris build on CRAN.

# quanteda.textstats 0.90

First version, split from **quanteda** 2.2.  This is a transitional version
designed to get the package on CRAN, so that we can shift existing reverse
dependencies to the new package, before we update **quanteda** with a new
version without the `textstat_*()` functions.
